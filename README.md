# Learning to predict taxi fares in the batch and online setting
Cabs have become an integral part of our lives. With the ease of use and the comfort that the online apps provide it is no wonder that names like Uber, Lyft, etc have gained such popularity in a short span of time. There is a huge amount of data collected and new data is added everyday. This makes it a good environment to use online algorithms. The motivation of this project was two-fold, one to experiment with different batch algorithms and loss functions, and investigate what works better and for what reason. Second, to compare the performance of batch algorithms to online algorithms, with respect to efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm.
